```php
<?php
function increment_array(&$arr) {
  foreach ($arr as &$value) {
    $value++;
  }
}

$numbers = [1, 2, 3];
increment_array($numbers);
print_r($numbers);

//The output will be [2,3,4]. The issue is with the foreach loop.
//The foreach loop creates copies of the array values and modifies these copies instead of the originals. 
//This means that the original array is not altered and the values passed by references are lost after the loop.
?>
